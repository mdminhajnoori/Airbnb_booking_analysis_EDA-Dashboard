# New York City Market Analysis
Project Overview
This project delivers an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Airbnb listings in New York City. The goal was to extract actionable insights to enhance guest satisfaction, identify growth opportunities, support host success, and refine pricing strategies, leveraging a comprehensive dataset of over 48,000 listings.

Business Context & Goals
Airbnb aimed to address challenges in the NYC market by understanding customer preferences, identifying emerging neighborhoods for expansion, empowering hosts, and optimizing pricing for revenue and guest satisfaction.

Dataset
Analysis was conducted on the "Airbnb NYC 2019.csv" dataset (48,895 entries, 16 columns), following extensive data cleaning and preprocessing.

Key Insights
Customer Preferences: Guests prefer entire homes/apartments, with Brooklyn (Williamsburg, Bedford-Stuyvesant) being most popular and Manhattan the priciest. Seasonal price increases occur from Oct-Jan.

Growth Opportunities: Staten Island and emerging Brooklyn areas show high growth potential; geospatial analysis highlights dense activity in Brooklyn and Manhattan.

Host Performance: Top hosts are identified by high review counts; a significant portion of listings lack reviews, indicating a need for host support.

Pricing Strategy: Pricing is heavily influenced by room type and location; seasonal fluctuations are notable.

Conclusion
The analysis provides critical data-driven insights for targeted marketing, host empowerment, and optimized pricing, strengthening Airbnb's position and driving growth in NYC.
